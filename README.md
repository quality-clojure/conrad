Don't let your code run wild.

Conrad is a simple linting library to keep code civilized.

## Usage

The general idea is to be able to programmatically check arbitrary code according to some arbitrary standards (or your own standards, which may be just as arbitrary).

Communication to and from the library is expected to occur via [core.async].
